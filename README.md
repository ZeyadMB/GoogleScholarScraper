Soltan is your loyal research writing assistant.
Just give him your Google Scholar Syntax, and he will start digging, no questions asked.

He will take the first 30 seconds before starting his digging operations, after that, he will scrape whatever he sees on GoolgeSearch result html page.
You can save this data on an excel file anywhere on your computer and extract whatever data you want from there, which is particularly useful if you're running a systematic review or similar.

Sol. also sends the dug-up articles to Zotero, where you can use your own addons from there to process that data anyway you want (lots of potential!).
#You need to have Zotero and Google Chrome installed, check your google profile directory with the Zotero plugin installed and insert it in 'Chrome Profile Path'.

If you already have a google chrome profile with Zotero-connector installed, then you can add its directory to the given prompt. If you don't have a Chrome profile, however, then feel free to use the given 'Profile 1' chrome profile on the same directory by taking its directory location and pasting it on the given prompt. 
(e.g.: D:\Projects\SoltanScholar1.6\Profile 1)
Also, whenever you change the settings, you need to press the "Update Settings" button to actually use those settings.

You can also adjust the SleepTime variables that enable you to wait for certain amount of time (in seconds) after a page had been loaded. This helps you NOT getting blocked by Google or other websites due to excess requests being sent from you IP.

Good luck, and have fun!
